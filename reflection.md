Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Changing procedural functions to reflect norms for OOP functions such as using "self" worked, but figuring out how code would work between the computer and oo_resale_shop files was confusing. I would advise someone taking this source to make their header comments as they write their functions rather than after the functions are already made.
